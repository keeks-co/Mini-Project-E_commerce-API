Hello Hello!
Welcome to my efficient E-commerce API.
To get started, there are a couple tabs to look out for. 

The "created_tables.py" contains the mysql connection and the tables that have been created in the SQL database. It gives you the details of each table and the relationships that are between them.
The "e_commerce_api.py" tab includes a bit more. It has the table schemas, routes and the functions for each route. Each table does have CRUD operations which can be executed in Postman.

Enjoy!
